I want you to create a modern, professional NextJS Japanese lanugage learning application. Here's my vision:

APPLICATION OVERVIEW:
Build a complete Japanse tracking web app that helps users manage their personal learning status. The app should feel modern, intuitive, and professional.

CORE FEATURES:
- Add tests with date, score, category (read, listen, write, speak), and description
- View statistics in a clean, organized list
- Dashboard with spending summaries and basic analytics
- Categories: Read, Listen, Write, Speak
- Data persistence using localStorage for this demo

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NextJS 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a modern, clean design
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Use React hooks for state management
- Form validation for test inputs
- Date picker for test dates
- Currency formatting for amounts

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, modern interface with a professional color scheme
- Intuitive navigation and user experience
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY:
- TBD

Please create this as a complete, production-ready application. Set up the project structure, implement all features, and make sure everything works together seamlessly. Focus on creating something that looks professional and that I could actually use to track my learning status.

When you're done, provide instructions on how to run the application and test all features.
